# Blockchain Merkle Trees Project

This project involves implementing Python code, to generate a valid Merkle proof for a specified leaf (#743) in a Merkle tree with 1,000 leaves. The project includes:

1. **`prover.py`**: Generates the Merkle tree, creates the proof, and saves it to `proof.txt`.
2. **`verifier.py`**: Verifies the proof against a hardcoded Merkle root to ensure validity.
3. **Example Proof**: A reference proof (`proof-for-leaf-95.txt`) demonstrates the expected format.

The system generates and verifies proofs, illustrating the integrity of Merkle tree operations. This project is a practical introduction to cryptographic proof generation and verification.
